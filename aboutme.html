    <p> Hi everyone, is a placer to meet you all.Let me introduce myself.Im single for the moment haha.Im from Venezuela but I live in Santiago,Chile since 2019 with my family and my dog Sammy. The weather in Chile is varied because all seasons are given, but my favorite is winter. </p>
    <p> I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was nine years old. I was baptized the same day as my older brother and our mother.</p>
    <p> Currently work in a company that sells mortgage loans, and I just finished two months in the commercial department this August. </p>
    <p> I really like to learn, that is why aplied to BYU Idaho in IT Tecnhology and because I want to achieve a Bachelor Degree, I do not have the opportunity to finish my studies in Venezuela even if I most finished. </p>
    <p> I love reading books and listening to K-pop music, going to concerts, and talking to my loved ones. I hope we can help each other. </p>
