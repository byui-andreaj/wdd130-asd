    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of my website is to try to create a page related to the profession that
      I develop as an executive of the commercial area in a company that manages mortgage loans, I would like to
      create a page that could be used in the future ,because this can be a possive thing for the imagen of the company
    </p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>As for the target audience, it would be people who are interested in choosing a loan and have no idea what kind
      of profile they should have and how to get it. I would like the site to be clear and precise enough to increase
      traffic.</p> <!-- change this -->
